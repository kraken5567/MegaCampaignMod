SHIMAZU_TADASHIGE_DESC_desc:0 "The 30th head of the Shimadzu family, Tadashige, was born at Sengan-en in 1886. During his childhood he used the name Hidemaru, and lived in the house at Sengan-en. When his father, Tadayoshi died in 1897, he inherited the title Prince Shimadzu and moved to Tokyo. He attended the Gakushuin School for peers as well as being educated privately at home by a British governess named Ethel Howard.\n\nIn 1915, Tadashige had an impressive palace built in the Gotanda area of Tokyo by noted British architect Josiah Condor (presently Seisen Univeristy). Tadashige joined the Japanese Navy, and after graduation from the Naval War College, travelled to Britain at his own expense to study abroad. In 1922, Tadashige founded Shimadzu Ltd. On his return to Japan he took a position as an instructor at the Japanese Naval College. Tadashige served as military attaché to Britain from 1928 until 1930. He eventually attained the rank of Rear Admiral and was a member of the House of Peers. After the death of his brother, Tadashige was coronated in 1932. Championed by many as a \"man of the people\", if something were to happen to him, the country may plunge into despair after centuries of prosperity."
